- **Read, Understand and Prepare Yourself** - Start by reading the Thing description and the "more info links" section. Watch the 3D animations, explore the printer's 3D model using the 3D viewer, and read the linked pages to fully understand the printer's structure.

- **Get the Parts** - The waiting period can be the most frustrating part. Ensure you have all the necessary parts, including spare T-nuts, screws, and other components. If you're using custom electronics, ensure you know how to correctly configure your board's firmware.

- **Build** - The building process isn't as easy as assembling a pre-made kit. Gather all the necessary tools and use a high-quality corner alignment tool for a precise structure to achieve excellent print results. Using the provided jigs can simplify assembly. Remember to tap holes at the corners and verify if you need M5 or M6 screws, depending on your extrusions' manufacturer. Take your time when fixing the rails to the extrusions. A quick video tutorial by 3D Distributed can help align parallel rails easily. Celebrate after installing the rails—you deserve it!

- **Electronics Installation** - Carefully install your electronics. Double-check all connections and the wiring diagram to ensure everything is correctly hooked up. Use the appropriate tools and parts, and only connect the power cable last.

- **Software, Tests, and Calibrations** - Update your DuetWiFi board to the latest version, upload the provided config to the micro SD card, insert it into the board, and power up the system. Verify that the Mini IR sensor blinks four times at startup. Check the endstop response before moving any axes. Attempt to home the printer, which should move to the left and then to the rear. If it doesn’t, inspect the motor wiring and configuration. Calibrate the Z height and verify the sensors' readings (temperature). Perform PID calibration for both the bed and hotend sensors to ensure successful prints. Once everything looks good, load filament and print a calibration cube.

- **Print** - Enjoy your printer and take care of it! Maintain it by greasing the rails with synthetic grease containing PTFE or sewing machine oil. Keep the rails clean and the belts tight. Clean the PEI build plate with alcohol after each print. If using the Air Scrubber, replace the HEPA filter as needed.
