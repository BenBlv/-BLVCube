# Overview

## Why?
The **BLV mgn Cube** was developed to provide a superior 3D printing experience by using high-quality MGN linear rails. These rails ensure exceptional precision and smoother motion compared to traditional Delrin wheels or linear bearings. By sourcing affordable MGN rails from platforms like AliExpress, the project offers high-end performance at a cost-effective price.

## Highlights
- **Rigid Open Structure**: A cubic design that ensures rigidity while providing easy access to the build plate and printed objects. The front belt tensioner adds convenience and usability.
- **Accessible and Affordable**: The BOM features easy-to-source components that can be 3D printed or bought online without expensive, custom CNC parts.
- **Open Source**: CAD files are included for full customization, and community contributions are encouraged to improve the project further.
