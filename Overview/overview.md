# Overview

## Why Choose the BLV Cube?

- **Fast, Reliable, Accurate**
  Most low to mid-range 3D printers use linear bearings or Delrin wheel gantries as cheaper solutions for linear motion. While cost-effective, they compromise on accuracy and reliability. The BLV MGN Cube utilizes linear guided rails (MGN rails) to enhance rigidity, precision, and smoothness‚Äîreducing print time without sacrificing quality. These rails are common in high-end 3D printers and are now affordably accessible.

- **Rigid Open Structure**
  Designed with an open front structure, it maintains cubic rigidity while providing easy access to the build plate and prints. A front belt tensioner adds convenience. This design is the result of extensive software simulations and physical stress tests.

- **Accessible**
  All parts are easy to source, print, or craft. The BOM avoids expensive, specially machined CNC parts or hard-to-find components‚Äîand if any are included, they're surprisingly affordable. Most parts can be printed or purchased online or locally. You can also use your own electronics, provided you have the knowledge to adjust the firmware.

- **Open Source**
  The original CAD files are included in the project folder‚Äîyou don't need to ask for them. Believing in community sharing, I encourage you to download, modify, remix, or improve the design as you like. If you share your modifications, please credit the original project and mark remixed parts accordingly.

- **Build and Print**
  I've spent many hours fine-tuning the firmware and slicing profiles (in Simplify3D) for this 3D printer. After assembling, you just need to upload the config files and load your slicing profile to start printing.

- **Modular Design**
  The BLV MGN Cube is more flexible than you might think. Both the Z-height and build plate size can be increased by purchasing longer aluminum profiles and MGN rails. The provided CAD files will help you calculate the right measurements for your customized printer.

- **Easy to Build**
  While installing the rails takes about 70% of the build time and requires precision, the satisfaction you'll feel when it prints is well worth the effort. To assist you, I've created instructive 3D animation videos, PDFs, sketches, and measurements.

- **Balanced Budget**
  Cost was a significant consideration, so the BOM is balanced to offer the best value without compromising quality. You'll find top-notch components like a 32-bit board, excellent stepper motors, and sensors. You can choose to include a 5" PanelDue touch screen or save $80 by using your smartphone or tablet without losing any features.
