# BOM | BILL OF MATERIALS

To build the printer, you need mechanical and electrical parts prepared in advance, along with parts designed for the BLV mgn Cube 3D printer. This section provides guidance on where to acquire the required parts. I have personally checked and organized the information optimally for you.

## Main Parts
### Should You Get the Official METAL KIT or Print All the Parts?

Many components of the printer need to be 3D-printed. While printing the parts yourself can save you money, it requires significant time and skill. After the project's release, I introduced the "BLV METAL KIT" — a high-quality aluminum kit that replaces most of the printed parts. The aluminum kit offers several benefits, including enhanced strength, reliability, and precision. Clearly, the "BLV METAL KIT" is the recommended option.

## Frame
### Which Frame Should I Get and From Where?

Buying from a local store is cheaper, but I released a new upgraded "BLV blind Joints" frame that saves 70% assembly time, is more stable, and accurate.

- **Get a Blind Joints Frame:**
  - Saves 70% of the assembly time
  - Easy Assembly, accurate, and stable
  - Bracket-free build
  - Costlier; ships from China/EU/USA warehouse
  - [Fysetc Blind Joints frame kit](#)
  - [Blurolls frame kit](#)
- **Purchase from a Local Store:**
  - Cheaper and faster shipping
  - Longer assembly time, less accuracy
