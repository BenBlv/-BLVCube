# BOM | BILL OF MATERIALS

To build the printer, you need mechanical and electrical parts prepared in advance, along with parts designed for the BLV mgn Cube 3D printer. This section provides guidance on where to acquire the required parts. I have personally checked and organized the information optimally for you.

## Main Parts
Should You Get the Official METAL KIT or Print All the Parts?
Many components of the printer need to be 3D-printed. While printing the parts yourself can save you money, it requires significant time and skill. After the project's release, I introduced the "BLV METAL KIT" â€” a high-quality aluminum kit that replaces most of the printed parts. The aluminum kit offers several benefits, including enhanced strength, reliability, and precision. Clearly, the "BLV METAL KIT" is the recommended option.

## Frame
Which Frame Should I Get and From Where?
|                                | **Get a Blind Joints Frame**                | **Purchase from a Local Store**          |
|--------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Advantages**                 | Saves 70% of the assembly time            | Cheaper                                |
|                                | Easy assembly [Check my review]           | Faster shipping                        |
|                                | Much more accurate and stable             |                                          |
|                                | Bracket-free build                        |                                          |
| **Disadvantages**              | Costs more                                | Long assembly time                     |
|                                | Shipping from China/EU/USA warehouse      | Not as accurate as Blind Joints Frame  |

### Important Notes

> Ensure the use of correct extrusions to maintain frame rigidity. Substituting 2040 profiles with 2020 profiles could compromise stability.
> The provided BOM is suitable for a 365mm Z-height. For custom sizes, use the `BLV_mgn_Cube-Frame_calculator.xlsx` in the project ZIP file.
> It is advised to use standard European extrusions with MGN rails instead of the V-slot type.
