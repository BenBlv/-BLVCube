## Overview

### Why?

- **Fast, reliable, accurate**: The linear bearing and Delrin Wheel Gantry are commonly used in most low-mid 3D printers as a cheaper solution for linear motion. However, they sacrifice accuracy and reliability. Linear guided rails (MGN rails) increase overall rigidity, precision, and smoothness, reducing print time without compromising print quality. These are typically found in high-end 3D printers, and when I found affordable MGN rails on AliExpress, I thought, why not?

- **Rigid open structure**: I focused on designing an open-front structure that is as rigid as a cubic frame while allowing easy access to the build plate and prints. The design includes a front belt tensioner for added convenience, backed by extensive software simulations and physical stress tests.

- **Accessible**: All parts are easy to source, print, or craft. You won't find any specially machined, expensive CNC parts in the BOM, and if any parts are unique, they’re surprisingly cheap. You can also use your own electronics, provided you have the knowledge to adjust the firmware.

- **Open Source**: You don't need to ask for the original CAD files; they are included in the project folder. I believe in community-driven improvements. Feel free to download the CAD files (STEP format) and modify, remix, or improve as needed. Please share your remixes with the community and link them back to this project.

- **Build and print**: I’ve optimized the firmware and developed the best slicing profiles (Simplify3D) for this printer. Once you build the printer, simply upload the config files, load the slicing profile, and start printing.

- **More modular**: The design is modular. You can increase the Z height or the build plate size by purchasing larger aluminum profiles and MGN rails. The provided CAD files will help you calculate the necessary dimensions.

- **Easy to build?**: Installing the rails will consume 70% of your build time. Accuracy is crucial, and aligning the rails may take hours, but the satisfaction of a successful print will be worth it. To simplify things, I’ve created instructive 3D animation videos, an information PDF, sketches, and measurements.

- **Balanced budget**: The BOM is optimized for a good money-to-value ratio without sacrificing quality. You can use a high-quality 32-bit board, excellent stepper motors, sensors, and even choose between a 5" PanelDue touch screen or saving $80 by using your smartphone or tablet.
