# WIRING

At this stage, we will install all the necessary wiring. This step is critical, and you must double-check each wire you install. The process can take around 3 hours or more, depending on your setup. If you have the FYSETC kit, the wiring process should only take about an hour due to its optimized wiring diagram and pre-arranged, labeled, and plug-ready cables.

FYSETC has also created a unique PCB for the NeoPixel rings, making installation quick (5 minutes). The NeoPixel project is plug-and-play, saving a lot of time. Be sure to use the correct wiring diagram for your setup.

## Few Tips

- Always wire your 3D printer with the AC plug disconnected from any power source.
- Crimp every cable you connect to the PSU (FYSETC kit cables are pre-crimped).
- Do not mix up negative and positive wires.
- Double-check every wire.
