# ASSEMBLY GUIDE

Well done! At this stage, you should have all the parts needed to build the printer. This is the most exciting stage, but it requires extra attention. Make sure you have the following tools at hand:

- Wire cutter
- Allen tool set
- Set of torque screwdrivers
- Tapping tools
- Protractor
- Aluminum 90-Degree Clamps (squaring tool)
- PTFE tube cutter
- SN-28B Dupont Crimping Tool

The assembly process has become faster and easier with new upgrades. The Blind Joints frame saves up to 70% of the time, and the Metal Kit reduces printing hours significantly. Follow these steps, whether or not you have the upgrades. A detailed guide based on the FYSETC and Metal Kit will be available soon.

## Belt System

Ensure belts are installed correctly. Metal Kit users need 0.6mm washers. Flip the belts at the rear so the flat side touches the bearings.

## Optional Components

### Reinforcements for Larger Z Builds

Add a 496mm extrusion for stability if building a taller Z axis.

### Air Scrubbers

Install HEPA and activated carbon filters to purify the air during printing. Replace filters as needed.

---

## Magnetic Heated Bed

Recommended: Aluminum MIC6 bed with an AC heating silicone mat. Note that 24V heating surfaces are safer but slower.

### FYSETC & BluRolls Kits

The FYSETC kit includes a magnetic aluminum bed. Request an upgraded magnetic metal bed from BluRolls.

---

## Internal Lighting: COB LED Strips

COB LED strips provide uniform light distribution. Connect directly to a 24V PSU or control through a Duet board. Use a slider to adjust light intensity.

---

## Linear Rails Assembly Tips

- Use quality rails from recommended sellers (e.g., CNA Mechanical Parts Store).
- Clean and lubricate rails with sewing machine oil or Teflon silicone grease. Avoid the "gravity test" for smoothness.
