## Do you have the Metal Kit for BLV mgn Cube?

### Option 1: I Have the Metal Kit

This version is lighter and excludes unnecessary files for those who have the METAL KIT. You only need to print the hotend setup and front panels. All other parts are optional. File size: **35.5 MB**.

## 3D Printing the Parts

Printing orientation and settings are crucial for functionality. Pay attention to the instructions.

### Print Settings

- **Walls/Perimeters**: At least 6 outer walls
- **Top & Bottom Layers**: 7 layers each
- **Infill**: 80%+ (specific percentages provided in sketches)

### Filament Recommendations

- **PETG**: Recommended
- **PETG Carbon**: Requires a hardened steel nozzle
- **ABS**: Needs an enclosure, emits toxic fumes
- **PA12**: MJF/SLS printed

Avoid using PLA/PLA+, as it may deform at high temperatures.

### Printing Orientation

The correct orientation impacts part strength. Refer to the guide provided for proper placement on the bed.

### Parts Gallery

A detailed gallery is available, with each part's name and printing method specified.

## Important Notes

If a detail contradicts these instructions, prioritize the general settings: 6 outer walls, 7 bottom layers, and 7 top layers.
